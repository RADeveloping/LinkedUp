# LinkedUp

The project is marketed towards students, in our case specifically BCIT students, who have difficulty
expanding their network beyond their set and/or program. This application will allow student's to "link" and connect with other students on campus.

This small project demonstrates:

- Read and write to firestore, a non-sql database
- Use of firebase authentication and creation of a users collection in firestore
- Custom login and sign up experience with the ability to upload profile photo.
- Customized user experience after login/signup
- Showing profiles of other users.
- Use of navbar in boostrap
- The ability for a user to edit their profile.
- The ability to direct message another matched user.
